## Frequently Asked Questions
[faq]: #faq

### What?
[what]: #what
SUCC is a modern, open-source C++ compiler, inspired by Clang, but with a few key differences.

### Why?
[why]: #why
Because I keep chatting shit about compilers on twitter dot com, so I figured I should put my money where my mouth is, and write my own to show people how it's done.

### How do I use SUCC?
[usage]: #usage
SUCC is designed to be flag-compatible with GCC and Clang, and should work as a drop-in replacement.

### How do I build SUCC?
[building]: #building
SUCC is not yet self-hosting, so for now it builds using your standards-compliant C++ compiler of choice. A Makefile is provided.

_Note: Building SUCC currently requires support for C++20._

### Does it support Windows?
[windows]: #windows
No.

### Can it actually compile things?
[wip]: #wip
We're working on it.

### Is this yet another joke you've put more effort than necessary into?
